## This is a simple task that uses [hammer to create a new domain][1] associated 
#  with our location and organization.  It also uses some facts gathered by
#  ansible.
#  The following variables are used and must be set elsewhere:
#  - sat
#      organization   # the organization used throughout
#      location       # the location used throughout
